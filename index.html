    <h2>My Expectations for ITC-C508</h2>
    <p>As a student of ITC-C508, I expect to gain a strong understanding of how advanced machine learning models are developed to perform 
        complex tasks autonomously. The initial readings introduced me to how businesses today are leveraging Machine Learning (ML), 
        Deep Learning (DL), and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate operations, improve productivity, 
        and enhance decision-making. I am especially excited to learn how advanced neural networks — such as feedforward and recurrent models — 
        are trained and optimized to perform predictions or language-related tasks using large volumes of data. For example, real-world tools 
        like Salesforce Einstein for sales optimization and DigitalGenius for customer service demonstrate how these technologies are already 
        transforming industries. I hope to acquire practical skills in dataset preparation, model training, and deployment in realistic 
        environments. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into mainstream technology, understanding how these models operate and can be 
        embedded into applications will be a major advantage in my career. I believe the instructor will guide us with valuable insights into 
        advanced ML topics, allowing me to confidently apply them to real-world problems. Ultimately, I want to learn how to design intelligent 
        systems that enhance functionality and drive innovation in the IT industry. With AI playing a growing role across all sectors, 
        this subject is crucial in preparing me to compete and contribute meaningfully in the professional world.</p>
